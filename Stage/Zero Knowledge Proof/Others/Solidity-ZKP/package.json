  "description": "<h1>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Library</h1><p>This library provides an implementation of a zero-knowledge proof system that can be used to prove the truth of a statement without revealing any information about the statement itself. ZKP can be used to improve privacy and scalability in decentralized applications.</p><p>The library is written in Solidity and provides the following files:</p><ul><li><code>ZKP.sol</code>: The main library file that provides full ZKP functionality.</li><li><code>ZKPParameters.sol</code>: Defines the public parameters of the ZKP system and provides functions for performing elliptic curve arithmetic using these parameters.</li><li><code>Circuit.sol</code>: Defines the circuit to be proved in the ZKP protocol and provides functions for adding gates to the circuit and computing the output values given the input values.</li><li><code>Prover.sol</code>: Implements the code that generates a proof of knowledge for a given input to the circuit.</li><li><code>Verifier.sol</code>: Implements the code that verifies the proof generated by the prover.</li><li><code>Helpers.sol</code>: Provides helper functions to help with the implementation of the prover and verifier.</li><li><code>ExampleUsage.sol</code>: Provides an example usage of the library, including how to define a circuit, how to generate a proof, and how to verify a proof.</li><li><code>TestZKP.sol</code>: A file providing tests to ensure the correctness of the library.</li></ul><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>To get started with the library, you can simply clone the repository and import the necessary files into your Solidity contract:</p><p>You can then use the library to define a circuit, generate a proof, and verify the proof, as shown in the <code>ExampleUsage.sol</code> file.</p><h2>Testing</h2><p>TTesting\r To run the tests, first ensure that you have Truffle and Ganache installed. Then, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:",
