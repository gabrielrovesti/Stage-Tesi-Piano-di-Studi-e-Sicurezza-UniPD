1 - First, individuals who are in need of aid would create a self-sovereign identity 
using a platform such as uPort or Sovrin. This identity would contain all of their relevant 
personal information, such as their name, address, and any other relevant details.

2 - Once an individual has created their self-sovereign identity, they would then be able to access 
the smart contract and request aid. They would provide their identity information as well as details 
about their specific needs.

3 - The smart contract would then verify the individual's identity using the self-sovereign identity 
mechanism. This would ensure that only those who are truly in need of aid are able to access the resources.

4 - Once the individual's identity has been verified, the smart contract would then distribute aid 
to them based on their specific needs. This could be in the form of financial assistance, food, or other resources.

5 - The smart contract would also record all transactions and distribute aid in a transparent manner, 
allowing donors to see exactly where their money is going.

6 - Finally, the smart contract would use the self-sovereign identity mechanism to ensure 
that individuals are not able to exploit the system by creating multiple identities or accessing aid 
that they are not entitled to.

Here is how this smart contract works:

1 - The Identity struct contains all the relevant personal information for an individual, 
such as their name, address, and the amount of aid they have received. The isRegistered boolean 
flag indicates whether the identity has been registered or not.

2 - The identities mapping maps addresses to their corresponding Identity struct.

3 - The registerIdentity function allows an individual to register their identity 
by providing their name and address. This function creates a new Identity struct 
and adds it to the identities mapping. The isRegistered flag is set to true, 
and the address is added to the identityAddresses array.

4 - The requestAid function allows an individual to request aid by specifying 
the amount they need. This function first checks to ensure that the individual is registered, 
and that the requested amount is greater than zero and less than or equal to the balance of the contract. 
If these conditions are met, the aidReceived field of the individual's Identity struct 
is incremented by the requested amount, and the requested amount is transferred to the individual's address.

5 - The getIdentityAddresses function returns an array of all the registered 
identity addresses. This function is only callable by the contract owner.

6 - The getIdentity function returns the name, address, 
and aidReceived field for a given identity address.
