## Common errors

### Error: Cannot find module './uws_win32_x64_111.node'

This is because of Node recent version usage. Just switch to a previous one, using "nvm" or something. 

### 'contract', 'before' and many others not found in tests

Just put some 'eslint-disable-next-line no-undef' and you're good to go
